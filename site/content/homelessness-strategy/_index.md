    The Manchester City Strategy (which you can download below) was co-produced
    by members of Manchester Homelessness Partnership. This includes people with
    personal insight into homelessness, people who work for the Council and
    frontline services. As far as we are aware, this is the first time a city in
    the UK has developed a strategy in this way.


    We believe that to end homelessness in all it's forms in Manchester, we have
    to work together towards a whole city response. We have asked each sector to
    create an action plan for how they can work to meet the requirements of this
    strategy. This includes responses from the council, health, housing, the
    voluntary sector, and businesses.
