    Homelessness is complex and anyone who is currently without a home should be viewed as
    an individual - not as part of a homogenous ‘homeless’ group. Lots of different people find
    themselves in lots of different situations of homelessness for lots of different reasons.

    
    > Rough sleeping represents the smallest segment of the homeless population.


    Often people think about people who are street homelessness or rough sleeping, but this
    represents the smallest segment of the homeless population (2-5% in Manchester). Other
    circumstances include people who are in emergency shelters, temporary accommodation,
    sofa-surfing, unsafe / substandard housing, and those who are at risk of being homeless.


    Anyone can become homeless, but it is often linked to poverty. We see a higher
    representation of people who have left the care system (~30%), prison system (~20%), and
    military (~20%). As well as a greater prominence of mental health conditions (~70%),
    substance misuse, and experiences of ACTs (acute-childhood trauma).


    ## Causes of Homelessness


    The main cited reason for why someone becomes homeless in the UK is ‘relationship
    breakdown’, in Manchester it is ‘eviction from private-tenancy’. In reality, there are often several compounding factors which lead to someone being in a situation of homelessness.
    For example; abuse, debt, and separation from their social support networks.


    > Homelessness has increased across the whole of the UK in the last ten years.


    Homelessness has increased across the whole of the UK in the last ten years and there are
    many external pressures which are influencing this:

    
    * Not enough social housing

    * Social housing stock being privately owned and managed

    * Not enough affordable housing

    * Section 106 (affordable housing requirements) being negotiated out of privately

    * Building houses but not building neighborhoods &amp; social infrastructure

    * People not being part of a community or other social support networks

    * Letting agents who discriminate against ‘DSS’ tenants or young people

    * Regeneration strategies that do not meet the needs of all citizens

    * Cities and spaces that you can only enjoy or feel a part of if you have money

    * Cuts to local government budgets and staffing

    * Reforms to the welfare system (Universal Credit)

    * Growing disparities in wealth distribution

    * Cyclical poverty and associated patterns of behaviours

    * A state support system and processes which does not fit the people it is for


    If you are homeless (or at risk of becoming homeless) you have to present at your local
    authority who will decided if there is a ‘statutory duty’ for them to support you.

    There are lots of ways you can contribute to our aim of ending homelessness. The
    organisations in our network post what they need on Street Support – have a look on Give
    Help and see if there is anything you can respond to. 
    
    There are also some bigger, reoccurring, or more urgent needs which you might be able to help with. If you can help, please contact [dee@streetsupport.net](mailto:dee@streetsupport.net).


    ## Bigger picture – systems change

    ### Community support

    The prevention of homelessness often starts with a conversation. If there is a friend,
    family member, neighbour or colleague who you are worried about - speak up.

    ### Ethical business practices

    You might have a strong social value arm of your business, but do you follow ethical
    business practices? (E.g. having a mental health policy and a good pay ratio). What
    support mechanisms are in place for colleagues who might be at risk of, or
    experiencing a form of homelessness?

    ### Advocacy

    Use your influence and networks to advocate and campaign for change on the wider
    factors that are causing more people to become homeless. This would include:
      * Need for more social, affordable housing and adherence to S106
      * More inclusive and transparent processes for how city decisions are made
      * Improved mechanisms for citizens to be informed on and influence policy
      * Greater public awareness around the ‘bigger picture’ of homelessness


    ## Urgent network needs

    ### Premises
    
    Many charities and services need a permanent base in the city centre. Do you have
    any land or building space which could be utilised by one of our partners?

    ### Renovations

    There are a number of drop-in centres and accommodation provisions that could be
    improved. Get in touch to find out more.

    ### Employment

    We would like to work with any organisation who is interested in inclusive
    recruitment. Get in touch to find out more.

  
    ## Reoccurring network needs

    ### Venues

    We need regular city centre hosts for meetings and groups, with catering if possible.
    
    
    Do you have any rooms we could book or use?

    ### Regular items

    We have a shared storage facility which needs to stay stocked up with coffee, tea,
    sugar, tinned goods, underwear, and toiletries. Can you donate these items?
