    The Manchester Homelessness Partnership (MHP) is a network of organisations
    which formed to work together towards the aims and values of the Manchester
    Homelessness Charter. Our goal is to end homelessness in all its forms in
    Manchester.


    The Charter was launched in May 2016. It unites many people with personal
    experience of homelessness with organisations from different sectors, to
    co-produce solutions together. Over 100 people who have personal insight
    into homelessness have been involved in the Partnership so far, many of whom
    co-wrote the Charter.


    The Charter and Partnership were created with no financial resource. In
    April 2018 we welcomed two full time roles, but nearly all of our work is
    still done voluntarily by the fantastic people in our network.

  body: >-
    At the heart of the Partnership are the [actions
    groups](https://charter.streetsupport.net/join-action-group/), which each
    tackle a key challenge that people who are homeless may regularly face. Each
    group includes people who have experienced the topic in question, as well as
    those who have relevant skills and roles. The groups include; Prevention,
    Migration & Destitution, Employment, Mental Health, and the experiences of
    Women & Young People.


    We also have a [partnership
    board,](https://charter.streetsupport.net/partnership-board/) which brings
    together representatives from different perspectives of our city. The board
    meets quarterly to use its collective influence to remove any systemic
    blockages that our network is facing. The driving group maintains momentum,
    supports the action groups, and protects the aims and values of the charter.


    The 'glue' of the Partnership is [Street Support
    Network](https://streetsupport.net); which has supported the charter mission
    from the start. Street Support Network host the two paid Partnership roles
    and are part of the driving group. They facilitate the network, help connect
    people, and communicate between the Partnership and out to others in the
    city through their website, App and other channels.


    We are also linked into the Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network.

    The Manchester Homelessness Charter unites people, organisations, and
    businesses together with one shared vision and set of values. The Charter
    has been co-created by people experiencing homelessness and the
    organisations which provide support services.


    _How_ we do what we do is very important to us. If you would like to be part
    of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership, please read the Charter and
    commit to working in line with our values. 


    Make a pledge to detail how you can contribute to ending homelessness.
    Pledges can be individual or organisational, big or small - we like the ones
    that happen!
